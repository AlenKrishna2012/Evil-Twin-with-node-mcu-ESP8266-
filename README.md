## 📌 Overview
This project is an **ESP8266-based Wi-Fi research sketch** designed to demonstrate
how Wi-Fi networks and protocols work internally.

The code showcases:
- AP + STA (Access Point + Station) mode
- Wi-Fi network scanning
- Captive portal behavior using DNS redirection
- Embedded web server control panel
- Low-level 802.11 packet construction (for protocol study only)
