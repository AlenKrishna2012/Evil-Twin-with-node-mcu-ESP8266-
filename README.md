## ⚠️ IMPORTANT WARNING
This project is provided **strictly for educational and academic study**.

- Creating fake access points, sending deauthentication frames, or intercepting credentials **without explicit permission** may be **illegal and unethical** in many countries.

❌ Do NOT use this code on real networks  
❌ Do NOT target networks you do not own or do not have written permission for  
✅ Use only in isolated lab environments for learning and research

## 📌 Overview
This project is an **ESP8266-based Wi-Fi research sketch** designed to demonstrate how Wi-Fi networks and protocols work internally.

The code showcases:
- AP + STA (Access Point + Station) mode
- Wi-Fi network scanning
- Captive portal behavior using DNS redirection
- Embedded web server control panel
- Low-level 802.11 packet construction (for protocol study only)

---

## 🧠 Educational Concepts Demonstrated
- Wi-Fi scanning (SSID, BSSID, channel)
- DNS redirection and captive portals
- HTTP server handling on ESP8266
- Promiscuous mode concepts
- Raw Wi-Fi frame structure
- Embedded HTML generation

---

## 🧰 Hardware Requirements
- ESP8266 development board (NodeMCU / ESP-12 recommended)
- USB cable
- Computer for programming

---

## 🧑‍💻 Software Requirements
- Arduino IDE
- ESP8266 Board Package
- Required libraries:
  - ESP8266WiFi
  - DNSServer
  - ESP8266WebServer

---

## 🌐 Web Interface (Conceptual)
The sketch includes a built-in web interface that demonstrates:
- Listing nearby Wi-Fi networks
- Selecting a network
- Handling form input
- Redirecting clients via DNS
- Dynamic HTML generation on microcontrollers
- Realist improved html page program

---

## 🧪 Intended Use
